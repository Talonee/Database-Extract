# Database-Webscrape

The project is currently **in progress** and is expected to have four (4) components, each performing separate functions: extract, encode + decode, input, and analyze.

## Extract 
File: `extract.py` 

This program's purpose(s): *(Complete)*
* Web scrape through an old web database to retrieve raw data.
* Clean, structure and enrich raw data into a desired format.
* Export data into CSV files to be used in Excel.

## Encode + decode
File: `encode.py + decode.py` 



These programs' purpose(s): *(Complete)*
* Encode output retrieved from **Extract**.
* Decode output retrieved from **Encode**. (*decode.py is hidden*)

## Input
File: `input.py`

This program's purpose(s): *(In Progress)*
* Navigate web database by web interaction.
* Read CSV files and automate filling/transfer data into input fields.
* Homogenize pre-exisiting user data.
* Integrate both web scrape and web interaction.

## Analyze
File: `analyze.py` *(Null)*

This program's purpose(s):
* Create graphs and models concerning data retrieved from **Extract**.
* Determine various statistical information within the data.
* Analyze and predict data trends.
