# Database-Webscrape

The project is currently **in progress** and is expected to have three (3) components, each performing separate functions: extract, input, and analyze.

## Extract 
File: `extract.py`

This program's purpose(s):
* Web scrape through an old web database to retrieve raw data.
* Clean, structure and enrich raw data into a desired format.
* Export data into CSV files to be used in Excel.

## Input
File: `input.py`

This program's purpose(s):
* Navigate web database by the interface.
* Read CSV files and automate filling/transfer data into input fields.
* Homogenize pre-exisiting user data.
* Integrate both web scrape and web interaction.

## Analyze
File: `analyze.py`

This program's purpose(s):
* Create graphs and models concerning data retrieved from **Extract**.
* Determine various statistical information within the data.
* Analyze and predict data trends.
